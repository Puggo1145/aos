// MARK: - System tray notice model
//
// Surfaces in the drawer that pokes out from below the main panel. Each kind
// is derived from a service signal (permission missing, no provider, config
// reset). Dismissing is session-scoped — the user can hide a notice for the
// remainder of the run; the underlying condition still drives onboarding /
// inline-disabled-input behaviour.

// `TrayItem` and `TraySource` live in `Notch/Components/TrayItem.swift`.
// The viewmodel composes registered sources into a single `trayItems`
// array consumed by `SystemTrayView`. Built-in system notices and the
// agent's live `todoProgress` row are themselves sources installed in
// `init` — there is no privileged path for them.

// MARK: - NotchViewModel
//
// Owns the Notch UI state machine + derived geometry per docs/designs/notch-ui.md.
//
// Holds (read-only) references to `SenseStore` and `AgentService` so the
// SwiftUI views can read context + agent state through one entry point.
// All mutation flows through @MainActor methods.
