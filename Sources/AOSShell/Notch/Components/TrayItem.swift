import SwiftUI

// MARK: - TrayItem
//
// Generic row model rendered by `SystemTrayView` (the drawer hanging below
// the main notch panel). Replaces the previous closed `SystemNotice` enum
// so any subsystem can register its own row without editing the view.
//
// Two consumer-visible variants of the right-side slot:
//   - `.action`  — a CTA label (e.g. "Open Settings"). Whole row is
//                  tappable when the item carries an `onTap`.
//   - `.badge`   — a numeric / status badge (e.g. "3/5"). Renders in a
//                  monospaced face so digits don't jitter as the badge
//                  updates between renders.
//
// Identity is a stable string namespaced by source ("system.*", "agent.*",
// future "skill.*", etc.). Used by:
//   - `ForEach`   — diff key for animation continuity.
//   - dismissal   — the viewmodel records dismissed ids in a `Set<String>`.
//   - tests       — assertions against the visible tray content.
//
// Closure properties (`onTap`) intentionally drop `Sendable`/`Equatable`
// conformance from the struct. Equality compares only the visible, value-
// like fields so tests can `#expect(item == reference)` without rebuilding
// closures; the synthesized comparison would have refused to compile.

// MARK: - Tray source
//
// A `TraySource` is a closure invoked on every `trayItems` read. Returning
// an empty array means "I have nothing to show right now"; returning a
// non-empty array adds those rows in the source's preferred order. The
// viewmodel concatenates sources in registration order, then filters out
// any row whose id has been dismissed.
//
// Sources are intended to be cheap pure functions of @Observable state —
// the viewmodel doesn't cache results. If a source needs to do real work
// (network, disk) it should compute the trayItem off-thread and surface a
// `@Observable` snapshot the closure can read synchronously.
