// MARK: - EventMonitors
//
// Singleton aggregating the four event sources the Notch UI cares about.
// Per notch-ui.md and notch-dev-guide.md §5.2 / §5.3:
//   - mouseLocation: drives closed↔popping transitions and edge highlight
//   - mouseDown:     drives popping/closed → opened, opened → closed
//   - keyDown:       drives ESC → cancel + close
//
// All publishers fire on the main runloop because every downstream consumer
// (NotchViewModel, EdgeHighlightOverlay) is @MainActor.
