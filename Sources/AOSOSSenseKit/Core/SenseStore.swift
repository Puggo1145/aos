// MARK: - SenseStore
//
// Per `docs/designs/os-sense.md` §"核心范式：live state mirror" and §"架构总览".
// Single owner of `SenseContext`; all writes funneled through @MainActor
// helpers. Producers (WindowMirror, GeneralProbe, registered adapters) push
// field-scoped updates; this class composes them into the canonical context.
//
// Clipboard is intentionally NOT a live producer: per design §"Clipboard
// capture" the pasteboard is sampled by the Shell composer at user-paste
// time. SenseStore therefore has no `clipboard` field and no polling loop.
//
// Multi-source `behaviors` slot (§"事件源与字段映射"): GeneralProbe + each
// adapter contributes a complete envelope set keyed by source id; the store
// merges them at every write so removing a source is just "forget that key".
// Order: general first, then adapters in registration order — keeps the
// chip row visually stable across app switches.
//
// Adapter plumbing (§"SenseAdapter 协议", §"加新 adapter 的成本"): on every
// frontmost change, the store queries `AdapterRegistry` for adapters whose
// `supportedBundleIds` cover the new app, attaches each (with a 500ms
// timeout + failure isolation per the design) and consumes the
// `AsyncStream<[BehaviorEnvelope]>` they return into `applyBehaviors`. App
// switches detach previous adapters before attaching new ones; concurrent
// swaps are serialized so cancellations don't tear adapter state.
//
// Visual fallback is **on demand**, not a live field. Submit-time capture
// only — see `captureVisualSnapshot()`. Continuous SCStream was rejected
// because it's the heaviest piece of background work in the read-side
// pipeline and the visual is only consumed at submit. The design doc was
// updated to match.
//
// Permission live-tracking: SwiftUI's `@Observable` change-tracking is used
// to react to PermissionsService updates without polling — when accessibility
// flips on, the probe + WindowMirror's AX side attach to the current app
// without restart, matching design §"权限".
