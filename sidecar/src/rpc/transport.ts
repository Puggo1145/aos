// NDJSON stdio transport for the AOS sidecar RPC channel.
//
// Per docs/designs/rpc-protocol.md:
//   - Framing: one JSON object per line, '\n' separated, UTF-8.
//   - Single-line cap: 2 MB. Exceeding the cap is fatal — the transport
//     closes and reports overflow so the Shell can respawn the sidecar.
//   - Writes from any task must be serialized via a single writer queue,
//     so partial-line interleaving cannot happen.
//
// The transport does no JSON parsing — that lives in the Dispatcher. It only
// owns byte framing and overflow detection.
