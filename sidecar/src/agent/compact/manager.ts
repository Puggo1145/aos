// Compact orchestration.
//
// `compactConversation` is the single function both the auto-compact
// path (called from `runTurn` entry) and the future manual `/compact`
// RPC entry will invoke. It is intentionally indifferent to which entry
// path called it — breaker accounting and threshold gating are the
// caller's job (see `autoCompactIfNeeded` below for the auto-path
// wrapper).
//
// The shape of work:
//
//   1. Snapshot every message strictly preceding the active turn.
//      The active turn (the user's just-submitted prompt + anything the
//      agent has produced for it so far) is preserved verbatim and
//      re-anchored on top of the summary. Compacting INTO the active
//      turn would mean the user's fresh prompt gets folded into the
//      summary, which is both wasteful and confusing — the model would
//      see "[Compressed]\n\n... user just asked X ..." and then have to
//      re-process X.
//   2. Issue a non-streaming-ish summarization call: same `streamSimple`
//      machinery as the main loop, but with NO tools, the compact system
//      prompt, and the snapshot wrapped with a final user nudge. We
//      consume the stream ourselves and pluck out the assistant text.
//   3. Hand the summary to `Conversation.compact`, which atomically
//      replaces the message buffer and prunes `_turns` down to the
//      active turn alone.
//
// All errors propagate. The auto wrapper translates them into breaker
// failures; the future manual wrapper will surface them as RPC errors.
