// Kept deliberately short and general (this harness is not coding-specific
// — same prompt has to handle email drafts, research threads, computer-use
// sessions, etc.). Four sections are the minimum that empirically retain
// enough state for the model to keep working post-compact:
//
//   1) intent     — what the user has been asking for, end-to-end
//   2) progress   — what has already been done / decided
//   3) current    — what the agent was actively working on at compaction
//   4) anchors    — concrete identifiers (paths, ids, urls, names) the
//                   model must remember verbatim to continue
//
// The NO_TOOLS preamble is the same idea Claude Code uses: tool calls
// here would be wasted (and on some providers will silently fail) — the
// model already has every byte of history it could possibly need above.
