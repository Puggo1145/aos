// Sidecar-owned conversation state.
//
// Storage model (post tool-use refactor):
//   - `_messages` is the single flat LLM history — `Message[]` exactly as
//     the model sees it. user / assistant / toolResult interleave naturally
//     (one turn may contribute many messages once tool calls land).
//   - `_turns` carries wire/UI metadata: id, citedContext, status, the live
//     `reply` mirror for `ui.token`, and a `[messageStart, messageEnd)`
//     range pointing back into `_messages`. The range is the only link
//     between the two views, and it grows append-only as the loop pushes
//     messages during a turn.
//
// This was previously stored as `prompt + reply + finalAssistant` per turn —
// fine for one user/assistant pair but it falls apart once a turn produces
// `assistant(toolCall) → toolResult → assistant(toolCall) → ... → assistant(text)`.
// Going flat aligns with how every LLM SDK already models history and
// removes the awkward `intermediate` bucket.
//
// Mutator contract (P1.2):
//   Each mutator returns `boolean` — true when applied, false when the
//   `turnId` is unknown. "Unknown" is the documented race after `agent.reset`
//   or `agent.cancel`: the in-flight stream may emit one more delta between
//   the abort signal firing and the loop's next `signal.aborted` check, and
//   that emission must NOT be promoted to a `ui.*` notification.
//
// Concurrency assumption: turns inside one Conversation are processed
// sequentially. Two turns in flight at once on the same session would
// interleave message ranges incoherently. The agent.submit handler is the
// only producer and it is single-threaded per session in practice; if
// concurrent turns ever ship, this storage needs revisiting.
